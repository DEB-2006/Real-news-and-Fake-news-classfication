Summery: This project addresses the challenge of distinguishing fake news from real news using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. After preprocessing and feature extraction from a labeled news dataset, several classifiers were trained and evaluated. The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X%, demonstrating the potential of NLP-based solutions for automated fake news detection.
